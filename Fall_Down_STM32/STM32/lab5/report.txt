1.the CS (Chip Select) pin is used to enable the correct device for communication.

2. By setting the CS high at the end of the pin initializations, it means no chip can be seleted.  f3d_gyro_read and f3d_gyro_write set low to high.

3. We are using the wires to hook up multiple peripherals on one SPI bus

4. I set the baud rate prescaler to SPI_BaudRatePrescaler_8. 72/8 = 9 MHz

5. Yes. a peripheral (slave) need to be configured with the transmission speed before it can communicate with the microcontroler. on-the-fly change may be necessary if a bus has two slaves with differing speeds.
