1. the significance of the peripheral base address is that it is a fixed address and it can used by the STM32 firmware which provides peripheral specific commands to enable a DMA transaction. it points to.&(SPIx->DR).

2.  It enable the incrementing so all data will not read/written from a single DR register. It will change the address to the next avalible data slot.

3. So, the program will automatic reset if it recieve flag.

4.  For transfers of less than 4 bytes, I think is the reason for not using the xchng_datablock functions is that it would wasted the unused space.

5. it is important for the DMA controller and the audio player to work on differnt portions of Audiobuf because it will make the code more efficent.

Difficulties : The nunchunk_init() really got us in trouble. First, we were putting it in a init() function and call it in main() function. However, it wouldn't pass the nunchunk_init(). And we move all the initialization from the init() function to main() fucntion, Then, it works.(have no idea why)
