1.  I am using the flash and RAM of the board. 
2. GPIO stand for General-purpose input/output.
3. I am not sure about this question. But my teamate told me that the provided delay function accurate.
4. port R44 R43.
   Pin 11 and pin 15.
5. I am not pretty sure about the public attributes but I google it. And it showed the result:

Public Attributes

uint32_t 	GPIO_Pin
GPIOMode_TypeDef 	GPIO_Mode
GPIOSpeed_TypeDef 	GPIO_Speed
GPIOOType_TypeDef 	GPIO_OType
GPIOPuPd_TypeDef 	GPIO_PuPd


Yes, the 4.1 f3d_led.c initial part was pretty confused. However, I found out that most of the function are provieded in the previous section and all I have to do is read the document manual and the lab instructions.
