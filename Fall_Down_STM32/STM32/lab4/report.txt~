1.How many connections are required to communicate over UART?
2 connections : pc5 to tx,
    		  pc4 to rx

2.What is the purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins?
THe purpose of "alternate functions" for GPIO pins is to change certain pin to perform a different action.

3.Define "baud rate" in your own words.
The rate that show how many bites we can transfer in a communication channel per second. 

4.why do we need newlib_stubs? Specifically, is there a reason that printf won't work on the board without it?
We need newlib_stubs to utilize the functions that we need. As I see it, it acts like a library for the board. And without it, the system wouldn't recognize the prinf function. 


5.Give an example of a situation in which the Salae Logic Analyzer is the best debugging method and include a screen shot of the Logic application.
 it provide visibility into what the hardware is actually doing.


6/ what did I learn and the diffculties.
The most difficult part is the last part, part 8. We were having trouble with the cat filename -| serial T part. We had the wc part working which is working through the board. However, when we test our program through a text file, it just doesn't write anything inside of the file.
Through the part 7, I learned that we need to create a file or library to provide functions that allows the board to recognize how to handle the typically services or functions.
