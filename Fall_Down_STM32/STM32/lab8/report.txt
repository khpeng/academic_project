1. The pins and nunchuk already initialized with the accelerometer/magnetometer. So, I am able to add the nunchuk without intializing anything.


2. In the i2c1_read function, it may send different number of bytes. Therefore, there is a loop to check how many bytes are going to be sent. in the nunchuk, it is a fixed 6 bytes to send.
    
3.   unsigned char jx;   joystick x-axis
  unsigned char jy;    joystick y-axis
  unsigned short ax;   accelerometer x-axis
  unsigned short ay;   accelerometer y-axis
  unsigned short az;   accelerometer z-axis
  unsigned char c;     c trigger buttons
  unsigned char z;     z trigger buttons

4.  In this code, each case represent a button pressed:
    Case 2: z pressed, but not c
    Case 1: c pressed, but not z
    Case 0: Both c and z are pressed
    Case 3: default case; c and z are not pressed

Diffculties: the difficulties in this lab would be the debug part for me. I still don't like use gdb to debug. It takes a lot of time to do it. And I always get into a time out by entered a wrong command and I need to restart the whole program.
